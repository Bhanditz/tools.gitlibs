tools.gitlibs
========================================

An API for retrieving, caching, and programatically accessing git libraries.

## Rationale

To access git dependencies (for example, via tools.deps), we need some way to download git libraries
and cache the working tree as indicated by git shas. The git library can be maintained and updated
via fetch. The working trees (at a sha) are immutable and can be cached and reused by anyone.
