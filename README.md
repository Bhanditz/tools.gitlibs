tools.gitlibs
========================================

An API for retrieving, caching, and programatically accessing git libraries.

## Rationale

To access git dependencies (for example, via tools.deps), one must download git directories
and working trees as indicated by git shas. This library provides this functionality and also
builds a cache of git dirs and working trees that can be reused.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.gitlibs :as gl])

;; Obtain a "git repo" - this will ensure the git directory is downloaded
;; and cached and will return a package of information that can be used
;; in subsequent calls
(def git-repo (gl/ensure-git-dir "https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha.git"))

;; git-repo:
;; {:git-dir #object[java.io.File 0x67817f98 "/Users/me/.gitlibs/_repos/github.com/clojure/spec.alpha"],
;;  :url "https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha.git"}

;; Obtain the working tree at a particular (partial) sha - may also use
;; full shas or annotated tag names
(def wt (gl/ensure-working-tree git-repo 'org.clojure/spec.alpha "739c1af5"))

;; wt:
;; #object[java.io.File 0x4641b1fe "/Users/alex/.gitlibs/libs/org.clojure/spec.alpha/739c1af5"]

;; Resolve a partial sha to a full sha:
(def commit (gl/full-sha git-repo "739c1af5"))

;; commit:
;; "739c1af56dae621aedf1bb282025a0d676eff713"

;; Check whether some dummy commit is an ancestor
(gl/ancestor? git-repo "12345678901234567890abcdefabcdefabcdefab" commit)
false
```

## Authentication

The following git url types are supported:

* https - for public anonymous clone and fetch of public repos
* ssh - for authenticated clone and fetch of private repos
* http - may work for public repos, but not supported or recommended
* git - may work for public repos, but not supported or recommended

ssh authentication works by connecting to the local ssh agent, which must have a registered identity. To check whether you have registered identities, use:

`ssh-add -l`

which should return one or more registered identities, usually one at ~/.ssh/id_rsa. If you don't see one but you have an ssh key, you can add it with:

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

If your key has a passphrase, you will need to enter it at this time.

## Cache directory

By default, the cache will be built in ~/.gitlibs/. To change the cache location, use kwarg option
`:cache-dir "/tmp/somewhere"` on `ensure-git-dir` and `ensure-working-tree`.
