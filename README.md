tools.gitlibs
========================================

An API for retrieving, caching, and programatically accessing git libraries.

## Rationale

To access git dependencies (for example, via tools.deps), one must download git directories
and working trees as indicated by git shas. This library provides this functionality and also
keeps a cache of git dirs and working trees that can be reused.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.gitlibs :as gl])

;; Given a git repo url and a rev (partial sha, full sha, or tag name), resolve to a full sha.
(gl/resolve "https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha.git" "739c1af")
;; => "739c1af56dae621aedf1bb282025a0d676eff713"

;; Given a git repo url, library identifier, and a rev, return a path to the working tree
(gl/procure "https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha.git" 'org.clojure/spec.alpha "739c1af")
;; => "/Users/me/.gitlibs/libs/org.clojure/spec.alpha/739c1af56dae621aedf1bb282025a0d676eff713"

;; Given git repo url, and a collection of revs, return the full sha of the one commit that is
;; a descendant of all other revs or nil if no such rev exists in the collection.
(gl/descendant "https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha.git" ["607aef0" "739c1af"])
;; => "607aef0..."
```

## Authentication

The following git url types are supported:

* `https` - for public anonymous clone and fetch of public repos
* `ssh` - for authenticated clone and fetch of private repos
* `http` and `git` protocols are plain-text and not supported or recommended

ssh authentication works by connecting to the local ssh agent, which must have a registered identity. To check whether you have registered identities, use:

`ssh-add -l`

which should return one or more registered identities, usually one at ~/.ssh/id_rsa. If you don't see one but you have an ssh key, you can add it with:

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

If your key has a passphrase, you will need to enter it at this time.

User/password authentication is not supported for any protocol.

## Cache directory

By default, the cache will be built in ~/.gitlibs/. To change the cache location, use kwarg option
`:cache-dir "/tmp/somewhere"` on `ensure-git-dir` and `ensure-working-tree`.

The cache directory is just a cache and can be safely removed if needed.
